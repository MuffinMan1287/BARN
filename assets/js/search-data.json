For the Hacks, create a game based on the following requirements: Objective --&gt; The game will take a string and give it a certain number of points based on a randomly selected letter . The game will split up each part of the string and add it to a list | Using a random generator, select a letter of the alphabet to assign score the word | Using ==relational operators==, check the letters of the string with the randomly generated letter, adding points to a score if there is a match | Using a ==nested conditional== and ==relational operators==, add additional points if the randomly generated letter is uncommon(ex. &#39;q&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;z&#39;) | Check the total score with a ==relational operator==, and print some sort of message for the user based on their score(ex. &#39;Good job!&#39; for scoring 2 points) | . Ideas for Extra Points: . Randomly generate a number, and if the user has the designated letter that many times, award them a bonus score --&gt; Nested conditionals, relational operators | Use user input | Randomly generate a score for the user, and if their final score matches the &quot;prediction&quot;, print a message --&gt; Relational operators | . import random string = &quot;Blank&quot; # Change this! stringlist = [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;] # Change this!
