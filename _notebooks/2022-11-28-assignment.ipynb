    "For the Hacks, create a game based on the following requirements:\n",
    "Objective --> The game will take a string and give it a certain number of points based on a randomly selected letter\n",
    "- The game will split up each part of the string and add it to a list\n",
    "- Using a random generator, select a letter of the alphabet to assign score the word\n",
    "- Using ==relational operators==, check the letters of the string with the randomly generated letter, adding points to a score if there is a match\n",
    "- Using a ==nested conditional== and ==relational operators==, add additional points if the randomly generated letter is uncommon(ex. 'q', 'x', 'y', 'z')\n",
    "- Check the total score with a ==relational operator==, and print some sort of message for the user based on their score(ex. 'Good job!' for scoring 2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas for Extra Points:\n",
    "- Randomly generate a number, and if the user has the designated letter that many times, award them a bonus score --> Nested conditionals, relational operators\n",
    "- Use user input\n",
    "- Randomly generate a score for the user, and if their final score matches the \"prediction\", print a message --> Relational operators\n"
